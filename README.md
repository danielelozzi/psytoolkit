# Psychological tests for Psytoolkit 

This code require psytoolkit software or psytoolkit platform psytoolkit.org

PsyToolkit is a free-to-use toolkit for demonstrating, programming, and running cognitive-psychological experiments and surveys, including personality tests. PsyToolkit is frequently used for academic studies, for student projects, and for teaching cognitive and personality psychology.
Is created By Prof. Gijsbert Stoet (Professor in Psychology - Essex University, UK)

Tests included in this repository are:

1) Long term memory assessment (SRT)
- Selective Reminding Test [Buschke, H. (1973). Selective reminding for analysis of memory and learning. Journal of Verbal
Learning and Verbal Behavior, 12, 543–550.] 

2) Information speed processing and divided attention assessment (PASAT)
- Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [Gronwall, D. M. A. (1977). Paced auditory serial-addition task: A measure of recovery
from concussion. Perceptual & Motor Skills, 44(2), 367–373.] 

3) Sustained attention assessment (RVIP)
- Rapid Visual Information Processing [Talland, George. Effects of Alcohol on Performance in Continuous Attention Tasks.
