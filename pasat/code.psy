# PASAT is cognitive task to measure selective and sustained attention and is also involved in the execution of the task. Numbers are presented visually and orally at a rate of about 1 seconds; the subject must add pairs of numbers, adding each number to the previous one. In this way, the first number will be added with the second, the second with the third, the third with the fourth and so on.
